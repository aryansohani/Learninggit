so what is git?
->consider git as a version control system which keeps track of all the updates you make in a project

how git works?
so there are two thing one is main directory and other is .git folder created -> git init -b main
git doesnt know which file to track so we basically push the file we want to tarck into staging area of .git folder-> git add Filename.type
now git can track these files and updates are made using commit and history is stores in commit history using -> git commit -m "message"
to get the commit history we use-> git log
to chnage email user name-> git config --global user.name "your name"
-> git config --global user.email "your email"


now we have seen that with when you have to commit something again you have to put the file in satging area using-> git add file.type
now to skip these process of staging and directly commit we have to use-> git commit -a -m "message"

i am creating these new to check -> git diff it provides difference between the last commit and new updates

When you have multiple file to add in git we use -> git add .  (these . means all files)
when you have to remove file from .git folder we use-> git rm --cached file.type


how to connect your local repository to the remote github repo
-> git init
->git add .
->git commit -m "message" //these will create a timestamp
->git remote add origin https://github.com/aryansohani/Learninggit.git ->these will be there when you create new git repo
->git branch -M main
->git push -u origin main

what are tag and how to tag?
git tags are basically version names given for the commits
we have to push the tags into remote repository
-> git tag
->git tag -a v1.0 -m "hello"  (-a annotation tagging)
-> git show v1.0
-> git push tagname

what is branching?
branching is basically a path or space where you can do experimental code without having tension of
existing code
-> git checkout branchname / git switch branchname  ->used to switch branches
-> git checkout -b branchname /git switch -b branchname -> use to create and switch to new branch
->git branch ->shows all available branches
-> to delete a barnch in local repo -> git branch -d branchname -> -d=delete
->to delete a branch from github remote repo-> git push origin --delete branchname
-> while deleting the branch you should switch to main first and then delete


what is merging?
merging means merging the feature/experimental files into main file
->git merge feature1

what is rebase?
basically git rebase and git merge work in same way that is merging branches in main
then whats the difference?
the difference is that git merge provides branches in commit log you can see branch and see it merge
the rebase on other hand give a clean list like look
hence 
if you want clean list - use -> git rebase branchname
if you want to know about which feature came from where and keep track - use -> git merge branchname
these is all about rebase

what is merge conflict?
basically when we are making changes in main and branch both but on same line and commit it
it causes merge conflict in which we need to choose with what we have to go with 
solving these conflicts is by removing what you dont want

what is pull?
baically when we want to make changes on remote repository we use push command 
when we make changes on remote repo and want same changes in local repo we use pull
-> git pull origin main 
push-> changes in local pc -> remote repo
pull->changes in remote repo ->local pc

what is git time travel?
->basically in git you can go to previous commits and can start branching from them
->consider you are in a situation where you have to make changes in previous better version so you start branching from that specific commit
-> code -> git checkout commitchecksum
->what happens after execution basically your head gets detached so now you have to create new branch to get back head pointer
-> git checkout -b branchname
-> now you can work on these branch and commit and also push to remote repo and it will be shown in the commit you made previous

what is git fork?
-> consider you are in microsoft vscode so as we know that you cannot push in vscode microsoft repo without license
->in such condition we use fork
-> fork basically create a clone repo for your acc eg vscode repo for aryansohani acc now you can easily pull the code make changes in it and push it 
-> in your repo (not offfical microsoft repo)
-> these is called forking ⑂ 
-> you just have to go vscode repo and click and fork and it will create new remote repo


what is git stash?
-> consider you are working on feature1 and suddenly you have to switch to main branch but you cannot commit in feature 1 because it is not complete
->in such condition we use git stash
-> git stash saves the changes on the file

->git stash
-> git stash list
->git stash apply    ->these are 3 codes in sequence

what is pull request?
pull request is basically after forking you made few changes in the file and now you have to tell the offfical owner to acknowledge and add your changes in such 
sitaution you can send them pull request
just go to github pull request tab check base repo<- main repo changes and then click create new pull request
add the message you want to send with it and send pull request
