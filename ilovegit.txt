so what is git?
->consider git as a version control system which keeps track of all the updates you make in a project

how git works?
so there are two thing one is main directory and other is .git folder created -> git init -b main
git doesnt know which file to track so we basically push the file we want to tarck into staging area of .git folder-> git add Filename.type
now git can track these files and updates are made using commit and history is stores in commit history using -> git commit -m "message"
to get the commit history we use-> git log
to chnage email user name-> git config --global user.name "your name"
-> git config --global user.email "your email"


now we have seen that with when you have to commit something again you have to put the file in satging area using-> git add file.type
now to skip these process of staging and directly commit we have to use-> git commit -a -m "message"

i am creating these new to check -> git diff it provides difference between the last commit and new updates

When you have multiple file to add in git we use -> git add .  (these . means all files)
when you have to remove file from .git folder we use-> git rm --cached file.type


how to connect your local repository to the remote github repo
-> git init
->git add .
->git commit -m "message" //these will create a timestamp
->git remote add origin https://github.com/aryansohani/Learninggit.git ->these will be there when you create new git repo
->git branch -M main
->git push -u origin main
