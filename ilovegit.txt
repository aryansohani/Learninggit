so what is git?
->consider git as a version control system which keeps track of all the updates you make in a project

how git works?
so there are two thing one is main directory and other is .git folder created -> git init 
git doesnt know which file to track so we basically push the file we want to tarck into staging area of .git folder-> git add Filename.type
now git can track these files and updates are made using commit and history is stores in commit history using -> git commit -m "message"
to get the commit history we use-> git logs
to chnage email user name-> git config --global user.name "your name"
-> git config --global user.email "your email"
