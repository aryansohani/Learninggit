so what is git?
->consider git as a version control system which keeps track of all the updates you make in a project

how git works?
so there are two thing one is main directory and other is .git folder created by git init 
git doesnt know which file to track so we basically push the file we want to tarck into staging area of .git folder-> git add Filename.type
now git can track these files and updates are made using commit and history is stores in commit history using -> git commit "message"
to get the commit history we use-> git logs
